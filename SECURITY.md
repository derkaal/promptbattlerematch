## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to [security@yourproject.com] with the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing

### Security Response Process

1. **Triage**: We assess the severity and impact of the reported vulnerability
2. **Investigation**: Our team investigates and develops a fix
3. **Testing**: We thoroughly test the fix to ensure it resolves the issue
4. **Release**: We release a security patch and update documentation
5. **Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability after users have had time to update

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

#### For Developers
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Use environment variables or secure configuration files
- Rotate API keys regularly (at least every 90 days)
- Use different API keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- Implement proper access controls and least privilege principles

#### For Users
- Store API keys securely using environment variables
- Never share API keys in public forums, chat rooms, or documentation
- Monitor API key usage for unusual activity
- Revoke and regenerate keys if compromise is suspected

### Environment Variables

Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```bash
# Good - Use environment variables
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

```javascript
// Good - Access via environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
```

```javascript
// Bad - Never hardcode secrets
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdef"; // DON'T DO THIS
```

### Secure Configuration

#### Required Security Headers
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Frame-Options`
- `X-Content-Type-Options`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`
- `X-XSS-Protection`

#### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong password policies
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper access controls

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All secrets are stored in environment variables
- [ ] API keys are not committed to version control
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and free of known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Authentication and authorization are properly configured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are in place
- [ ] Regular security audits are scheduled

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- Work with security researchers to understand and fix vulnerabilities
- Provide credit to researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Maintain transparency about security issues while protecting users
- Follow industry best practices for vulnerability disclosure
